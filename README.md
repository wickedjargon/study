# study

A flashcard quiz tool inspired by suckless sent. Decks are plain text files. The default card order, `adaptive`, is an evidence-based [spaced-repetition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaced_repetition) scheduler: it picks what's due, spaces repetitions within the session, and grows review intervals across days.

There are two frontends over the same engine, deck format, and progress files:

- **`study` (desktop)** — sessions run in a minimal X11 window; progress is saved per user under `~/.local/share/study`.
- **`study-web` (web)** — the same quizzes in a browser. Visitors are guests identified by a cookie, each with their own progress, no account needed. Decks are organized two levels deep: pick a language, then a topic (or its merged "Everything").

The `adaptive` order is based on these papers:

- Rawson, K. A., & Dunlosky, J. (2011). [Optimizing schedules of retrieval practice for durable and efficient learning: How much is enough?](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21707204/) *Journal of Experimental Psychology: General, 140*(3), 283–302. — the session criterion: three correct recalls for new material, one per relearning session.
- Karpicke, J. D., & Bauernschmidt, A. (2011). [Spaced retrieval: Absolute spacing enhances learning regardless of relative spacing.](https://learninglab.psych.purdue.edu/downloads/2011/2011_Karpicke_Bauernschmidt_JEPLMC.pdf) *Journal of Experimental Psychology: Learning, Memory, and Cognition, 37*(5), 1250–1257. — within-session spacing: any nonzero gap between repetitions beats none, and the gap pattern doesn't matter.
- Kornell, N., & Bjork, R. A. (2008). [Learning concepts and categories: Is spacing the "enemy of induction"?](https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1467-9280.2008.02127.x) *Psychological Science, 19*(6), 585–592. — interleaving: a card confused with another is pulled near it, so the pair is told apart.
- Atkinson, R. C. (1972). [Optimizing the learning of a second-language vocabulary.](https://doi.org/10.1037/h0033475) *Journal of Experimental Psychology, 96*(1), 124–129. — gradual introduction: new cards enter a few at a time as earlier ones are learned, not as one big batch.
- Cowan, N. (2001). [The magical number 4 in short-term memory: A reconsideration of mental storage capacity.](https://doi.org/10.1017/S0140525X01003922) *Behavioral and Brain Sciences, 24*(1), 87–114. — the size of the introduction window.

The specific review intervals (1, 3, 7, … days) and the lapse handling (halving a card's level) are conventional heuristics in the spirit of this literature, not prescribed by it.

# Getting started

- Requires Go.
- Installs to `~/.local/bin`.

To install, run:

```bash
make clean install
```

Save this as `example.deck`:

```
2 + 2
---
4

What is the capital of Canada?
---
Ottawa
~ Toronto
~ Vancouver
~ Montreal
```

- The two cards above are separated by a blank line.
- `---` or `===` separate question and answer.
- In the first card above, the user is prompted with `2 + 2` and must type `4`.
- In the second card above, the user is prompted with multiple choice options.
- The `~` mark indicates a wrong answer.

Run it:

```bash
study example.deck
```

For more, [examples/basic.deck](examples/basic.deck) is a small beginner deck,
and the [language packs](https://github.com/wickedjargon/study-language-packages)
are full-size decks with audio, native script, and pack directories.

# Web version

```bash
make study-web
./study-web [flags] <deck-or-dir>...
```

Each argument is a deck (a `*.deck` file or pack directory), or a directory of
decks. `group=path` nests a pack as a topic of an existing group;
`path@Display Name` overrides the name shown. `make run` starts the server
with this machine's decks — see [RUNNING.md](RUNNING.md).

The web version follows the same scheduler as the desktop, with two guest
conveniences: unseen cards introduce themselves once before being quizzed
("skip intros" turns that off), and every deck offers a review mode that flips
through cards, answers visible, without recording anything.

# Desktop usage

```
study [flags] <deck-file | pack-directory>
```

| Flag | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `--reverse` | Flip the deck: see the English, produce the target language |
| `--order <mode>` | Override the deck's card order for this session. See [Card order](#card-order) |
| `--answer-mode <type\|choice>` | Force how every card is answered this session, overriding the deck's `# answer-mode:` and per-card settings. Note the card's progress history is shared between modes, and recognition (choice) successes are easier evidence than production (type) ones |
| `--ahead <N\|all>` | Adaptive order: also review cards due within N days, or all scheduled. See [Card order](#card-order) |
| `--time-limit <N\|none>` | Override the per-question time limit, uniformly for every card |
| `--wrong-pause <N\|none>` | How long a wrong answer's result screen refuses to advance (default 5s) |
| `--preview-new` | Reveal a never-studied card's answer once before quizzing it |
| `--new-per-session <N\|all>` | How many never-studied cards enter an adaptive session (default 10) |
| `--font-size <N>` | Override the base font size (8–48, or `small`/`medium`/`large`/`x-large`) |
| `--audio-speed <X>` | Override audio playback speed (0.25–4.0) |
| `--stats` | Print progress summary (incl. what's due) and exit |
| `--forget` | Clear saved progress for the studied direction only (combine with `--reverse`) |
| `--help` | Show help |

## Card order

Set with the `--order` flag or the `# order:` deck header:

| Mode | Behavior |
|------|----------|
| `adaptive` | **Default: "what's due?"** Reviews that are due plus a batch of new cards, with spaced repetitions. Review intervals grow across days. When nothing is due, says so — and offers to keep studying anyway, ahead of schedule; new cards still enter a batch at a time, and early reviews don't advance the intervals (see `--ahead`). |
| `sequential` | **"In order."** Deck order, wrapping forever. Misses get the immediate-repeat drill. For material where the sequence is the content: verse, digits, procedures. |
| `flip-through` | **"Just show me."** Answers visible, enter advances, wraps at the end. Nothing recorded. |
| `weak-only` | **"What am I bad at?"** Cram mode: only weak or never-studied cards, ignoring review dates. |

# Deck format

## Accepted answers

`=` after the answer adds an extra accepted answer (type mode). Matching is
lenient by default. Case, accents, punctuation, and extra spaces are
forgiven (`salam` matches `salâm`):

```
bonjour
---
hello
= hi
```

## Alternative prompt wordings

`=` on the question side is an alternative wording of the prompt, accepted
when the prompt is what you type (`--reverse`). It's never displayed, and
adding one doesn't re-key the card:

```
¿Prefiere ventanilla o pasillo?
= prefieres ventanilla o pasillo
---
do you prefer window or aisle
```

## Media

`@img` and `@audio` ride on the side they're written on. Paths are relative
to the deck file, and audio plays automatically (needs `mpv` or `aplay`):

```
@img flags/japan.png
@audio audio/konnichiwa.mp3
How do you say "hello"?
---
こんにちは
```

## Cloze

A card with no separator and a `{{...}}` deletion blanks the braced text
(`____`) and makes it the answer. Multiple deletions join in order:

```
The capital of France is {{Paris}}.
```

## Per-card overrides

`# answer-mode:`, `# choice-count:`, and `# time-limit:` inside a card block
apply to that card only (`# time-limit: none` exempts it):

```
# choice-count: 2
# time-limit: none
What is 1 + 1?
---
2
```

## Header directives

| Header | Flag | Values | Default |
|--------|------|--------|---------|
| `# answer-mode:` | file-only | `choice`, `type` | `type` |
| `# choice-count:` | file-only | integer ≥ 2 | `4` |
| `# answer-case:` | file-only | `sensitive`, `insensitive` | `insensitive` |
| `# time-limit:` | `--time-limit` | seconds, or `none` | `none` |
| `# order:` | `--order` | see [Card order](#card-order) | `adaptive` |
| `# preview-new:` | `--preview-new` | `on`, `off` | `off` |
| `# new-per-session:` | `--new-per-session` | integer ≥ 0, or `all` | `20` |
| `# wrong-pause:` | `--wrong-pause` | seconds, or `none` | `5` |
| `# font-size:` | `--font-size` | `8`–`48`, or `small`/`medium`/`large`/`x-large` | `10` |
| `# audio-speed:` | `--audio-speed` | `0.25`–`4.0` | `1.0` |

- A flag overrides the deck-header setting of the same name for that session.

# Controls
